## Maintenance

- **Code and KB move together** — update `brain/kb/` after every meaningful feature, API, schema, auth, UI, workflow, deploy, or test-strategy change.
- Edit rules under `brain/rules/` — keep `standards.md` lean; put stack/workflow/testing detail in the modular files.
- Re-run **kenmark-init** to refresh IDE pointer stubs (or `sync-full` embeds) after changing standards or stub template.
- Never delete the `brain/` folder.
